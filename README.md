# 🕶️ ahromi.blog

Welcome to the official repo of **[ahromi.blog](https://ahromi.vercel.app)** — a blog built by a QA Automation Engineer, for QA Automation Engineers (and anyone else who’s into clean setups and chaotic good automation).

---

## 🤔 What is this?

This is the source code for my personal blog — powered by **Next.js**, **Notion API**, and a whole lot of testing energy.  
It’s where I write about Katalon, automation frameworks, testing strategies, and the occasional meme that sneaks into my workflow.

> _Originally forked from [morethan-log](https://github.com/morethanmin/morethan-log), but heavily customized to fit the vibe of ahromi.blog — from layout to theming, and content structure to automation philosophy._

**Slogan:**  
🕶️ _Move in Silence, Automate with Violence._
